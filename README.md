- Modern web browser

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
# Clone the repository (or copy files)
cd fish-tapper
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Supabase

1. Create a new project at [https://app.supabase.com](https://app.supabase.com)
2. Once created, go to **SQL Editor** in your project
3. Copy and paste the entire contents of `supabase-setup.sql`
4. Run the SQL script to create the table and policies

### 3. Configure Environment

1. In Supabase, go to **Settings > API**
2. Copy your **Project URL** and **anon public** key
3. Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Edit `.env` and replace the placeholders:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-public-key-here
```

### 4. Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The game will open automatically at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## üì¶ Production Build

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized build in the `dist` directory.

### Preview Production Build

```bash
npm run preview
```

## üåê Deployment

The built app is a static site that can be deployed to:

### Vercel
```bash
npx vercel --prod
```

### Netlify
```bash
# Drag and drop the dist folder to Netlify
# Or use CLI:
npx netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

### GitHub Pages
```bash
# Add to package.json scripts:
"deploy": "vite build && gh-pages -d dist"

# Then run:
npm run deploy
```

### Static Hosting
Upload the contents of `dist` folder to any static hosting service (AWS S3, Firebase Hosting, etc.)

## üîí Security Notes

- **Never commit `.env` files** - They contain sensitive keys
- **Use only anon keys** - Never expose service keys in frontend
- **RLS is enabled** - Database access is restricted by policies
- **Input validation** - Names are sanitized and length-limited
- **Score validation** - Only non-negative scores are accepted

## üéØ Game Rules

1. Enter your name (1-24 characters)
2. Click "Start Game" to begin
3. Click/tap fish as they swim in the water
4. Fish start slow and gradually speed up
5. Each successful hit scores 1 point with splash effects
6. Game ends after 30 seconds
7. Your score is automatically saved to the ELSA IoT leaderboard
8. Compete with the community for the top spot!

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Supabase Connection Issues

**Problem**: "Database not configured" message
- **Solution**: Check `.env` file has correct Supabase URL and key

**Problem**: Scores not saving
- **Solution**: Verify RLS policies are created correctly in Supabase

### Build Issues

**Problem**: Build fails with module errors
- **Solution**: Delete `node_modules` and run `npm install` again

### Game Performance

**Problem**: Low FPS or laggy gameplay
- **Solution**: Close other browser tabs, use Chrome/Firefox for best performance

## üìä Database Schema

```sql
public.scores
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ id (uuid, primary key)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ name (text, 1-24 chars)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ score (integer, >= 0)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ created_at (timestamptz)
```

## üîß Configuration Options

Edit these constants in `src/components/GameCanvas.jsx` for difficulty tuning:

```javascript
const GAME_DURATION = 30;                    // Game length in seconds
const FISH_RADIUS = 35;                      // Fish size in pixels
const INITIAL_FISH_MIN_LIFETIME = 1500;      // Starting fish visibility (ms)
const INITIAL_FISH_MAX_LIFETIME = 2000;      // Starting max visibility
const FINAL_FISH_MIN_LIFETIME = 600;         // Ending fish visibility (faster)
const FINAL_FISH_MAX_LIFETIME = 900;         // Ending max visibility
const INITIAL_SPAWN_DELAY = 800;             // Starting spawn delay
const FINAL_SPAWN_DELAY = 200;               // Ending spawn delay (faster)
```
